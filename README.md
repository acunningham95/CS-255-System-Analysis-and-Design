# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is an initiative by Liam to offer a platform aiding individuals in preparing for their driving tests. Recognizing a gap in the market for effective driver training, DriverPass aims to provide online classes, practice tests, and optional on-road training. The client, DriverPass, represented by Liam and Ian, sought a system that could manage these functionalities, handle reservations for driving lessons, and track user interactions, among other features.

What did you do particularly well?
Make diagrams on visio.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Diving deeper into the UML and use case diagrams initially might have provided a quicker grasp of system components and interactions. In the future, starting with these diagrams could offer a foundational understanding, which can be further empowered with a textual documents.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By closely examining the interview transcript and the business requirements document, I discerned the client's priorities and needs. Integrating user requirements is paramount in system design to ensure the end product is functional, user-friendly, and addresses the primary challenges. A design that doesn't cater to the user's needs may end up being ineffectual, leading to wasted resources and dissatisfaction.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In software design, my approach is user-centric, starting with understanding the client's needs through interviews and requirement documents. I then move to high-level design using UML and use case diagrams to visualize system components and interactions. Iterative feedback loops with stakeholders ensure alignment. In the future, leveraging techniques like prototyping, user journey mapping, and continuous feedback can further enhance system design and alignment with user needs.
